ASSIGNMENT FOR "CLUSTER COMPUTING" (14th January 2021)
------------------------------------------------------

ANALYSYS OF THE COMPUTATION OF PI BASED ON THE LEIBNIZ SERIES

In this assignment you are going to work with a parallel code written in C using the OpenMP library:

= pi.c ===========================================
#include <omp.h>
#include <math.h>
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>

int main (int argc, char *argv[])
{

  //initialize variables
  int i;
  double pi = 0;
  int niter = 1000000000;

  // Get timing
  double start,end;
  start=omp_get_wtime();

  // Calculate PI using Leibnitz sum
  /* Fork a team of threads */
  #pragma omp parallel for reduction(+ : pi)
  for(i = 0; i < niter; i++)
  {
     pi = pi + pow(-1, i) * (4 / (2*((double) i)+1));
  } /* Reduction operation is done. All threads join master thread and disband */

  // Stop timing
  end=omp_get_wtime();

  // Print result
  printf("Pi estimate: %.20f, obtained in %f seconds\n", pi, end-start);
}
==================================================


The code needs to be compiled with the following commands on Lisa:

= compilepi ======================================
#!/bin/bash

module load 2020
module load GCC
gcc -fopenmp -o pi pi.c -lm
==================================================


The basis script to submit the job would be as follows:

= pi.sh ==========================================
#!/bin/bash
#SBATCH --job-name="pi"
#SBATCH --nodes=1
#SBATCH --ntasks=1
#SBATCH --cpus-per-task=24
#SBATCH --time=00:10:00
#SBATCH --partition=normal
#SBATCH --output=pi_%j.out
#SBATCH --error=pi_%j.err

module purge
module load 2020
module load GCC

echo "OpenMP parallelism"
echo

for ncores in {4..24}

do
  export OMP_NUM_THREADS=$ncores

  echo "CPUS: " $OMP_NUM_THREADS
  echo "CPUS: " $OMP_NUM_THREADS >&2
  ./pi
  echo "DONE "
done
==================================================


Given the previous introduction, please do the following tasks:

- Compile and run the pi computation with 1 to 24 threads. Plot a graph to show the execution times of the computation (Y-axis) with respect to the amount of numbers in the Leibniz series (X-axis). How would you explain the observed performance, considering that an average node of Lisa has 16 processors?
- Compile the code with 31250000, 62500000, 125000000, 250000000, 500000000, 1000000000 and 2000000000 numbers in the Leibniz series and run the pi computation only with 24 threads in all cases. Plot a graph to show the execution times of the computation (Y-axis) with respect to the amount of threads (X-axis).
- Taking the simulation of 2000000000 numbers and 24 threads as a reference, how would you create another graph in which you would show the weak scaling of the problem from 1 to 24 threads?
